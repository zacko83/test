# Authenticating Clients using X.509 Certificates

Often client authentication is accomplished using shared keys (aka client secrets). Another option is to use X.509
client certificates.

## Registering the client
You are in full control of how you want to map a client certificate to a corresponding client secret by implementing `ISecretValidator`.
The default implementation uses the thumbprint of the certificate to map to the right client.

The following snippet registers a client for client credentials flow:

```csharp
var certClient = new Client
{
    ClientName = "Client Credentials Flow Client with Client Certificate",                   
    ClientId = "certclient",
    
    ClientSecrets = new List<Secret>
    { 
        new Secret
        {
            Value = "61B754C541BBCFC6A45A9E9EC5E47D8702B78C29",
            Type = Constants.SecretTypes.X509CertificateThumbprint,
        }
    },

    Flow = Flows.ClientCredentials,
                    
    AllowedScopes = new List<string> 
    {
        "read", 
        "write"
    },
}
```

## Configuring the host

You need to configure your host to accept client certificates. For IIS you need to create a location element for the token
endpoint that configures the client cert and SSL settings:

```xml
<location path="core/connect/token">
  <system.webServer>
    <security>
      <access sslFlags="Ssl, SslNegotiateCert" />
    </security>
  </system.webServer>
</location>
```

**Remark** The SSL settings are locked down by default in IIS - you might need to set them to `Read/Write` in the feature
delegation configuration.

## Requesting the token

To request a token, you need to supply the client certificate to the HTTP client and add the client ID to the post body.
The following example uses the IdentityModel OAuth2 client:

```csharp
async Task<TokenResponse> RequestTokenAsync()
{
    var cert = new X509Certificate2("Client.pfx");

    var handler = new WebRequestHandler();
    handler.ClientCertificates.Add(cert);

    var client = new OAuth2Client(
        new Uri("https://identityserver.io/core/connect/token"),
        "certclient",
        handler);

    return await client.RequestClientCredentialsAsync("read write");
}
```
