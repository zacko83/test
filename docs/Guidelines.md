# Developer Guidelines

## Introduction

This documentation serves as a guideline for developers to implement new projects and applications. But also concerning the modification and/or refactoring of existing projects, these principles must be taken into account and have to be applied as good as possible.

The purpose of this rule book is to keep the code consistent, readable and clean. Usually there is more than one solution for a problem. This also counts for development guidelines. Hence we must agree on a set of rules.

This guide aims to cover the essential aspects of our daily life as developers in this company. There are countless other topics and details, that would fill up a whole bookshelfs (and they do:-). Just because a subject is not addressed in this document, doesn't mean it's not important and it definitely doesn't mean you can ignore it. Use your common sense and always write the best and cleanest code you can.

Of course, nothing is cut in stone. As technologies change, also rules must adapt. If you believe, a rules is not suitable for a certain project or it should be adjusted in general, feel free to contact team architecture.
